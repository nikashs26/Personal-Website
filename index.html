        Worked in a team during AWS/INRIX Hack 2024 to build a functional parking detection model. This model

        and returns this number to the user. Primarily
        worked on frontend, using JS and CSS, and assisted backend developers. Presented our work
        to panels of judges, and it achieved
        a finalist rank.
